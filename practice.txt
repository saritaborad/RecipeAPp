Assignment: Interactive Recipe Application using Node.js and Vue.js/React.js

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to assess your skills as a full-stack developer with experience in Node.js
and either Vue.js or React.js. You will be required to build an interactive recipe application that allows users to search for
recipes, view details, and save their favorite recipes. The assignment will focus on creating a responsive user interface,
implementing data retrieval from a third-party API, and managing user preferences.
Requirements:

1. Backend Development
Create a Node.js server using Express.js MVC.
Implement RESTful API endpoints to handle recipe search and user preferences.
Integrate with a third-party API (e.g., Spoonacular API https://spoonacular.com/food-api
(https://spoonacular.com/food-api)) to fetch recipe data based on user searches.
Implement user registration and authentication using OAT.
Store user preferences (e.g., saved recipes) in a database mongodb.

2. Frontend Development
Choose either React.js for the frontend development.
Design and implement a user interface that allows users to search for recipes using keywords or filters.
Display search results with relevant recipe information (e.g., title, image, summary).
Implement a recipe details page that displays additional information such as ingredients, instructions, and
nutritional information.
Allow users to save their favorite recipes and view their saved recipes.
Implement responsive design and ensure cross-browser compatibility.

3. Additional Requirements
Use Git for version control and maintain a well-structured repository.
Write clean, maintainable, and documented code, following best practices and industry standards.
Implement error handling and provide meaningful error messages to the user.
Implement loading indicators during API calls and other asynchronous operations.
Implement pagination or infinite scrolling for search results (optional but recommended).
Enhance the user experience with features like sorting, filtering, and categorization of recipes (optional).
Submission Guidelines:
1. Create a new GitHub repository for your project and commit your code regularly.
2. Include a README.md file with instructions on how to set up and run your application locally.
3. Share the GitHub repository with user https://github.com/webledgerBot (https://github.com/webledgerBot) and any
other relevant information with the evaluator.
Evaluation Criteria:
1. Fulfillment of the assignment requirements.
2. Code quality, including organization, structure, readability, and documentation.
3. User interface design and responsiveness.
4. Implementation of server-side functionality and integration with the third-party API.
5. User authentication and storage of user preferences.
6. Proper use of version control (Git) and project structure.
7. Deployment and overall user experience.
